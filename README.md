## Installation on a Raspberry Pi
* Follow the [installation guideline](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/v2.11.0/install/) from Luxonis for the OAK-D [depthai-python](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python/tree/v2.14.1.0) package.
* If your Pi is not named "pi" then just replace it with your Pi's name.
* Clone this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/simonkaserer/Contour_Recognition.git```
* Install the requirements with: ```pip3 install -r /home/pi/Contour_Recognition/requirements.txt```
* Change the directory: ```cd /home/pi/Contour_Recognition```
* Make *Contour_Extraction_GUI.py* executable with: ```chmod +x Contour_Extraction_GUI.py```
* Make *Camera_Calibration.py* executable with: ```chmod +x Camera_Calibration.py``` 
* Create a link to *Contour_Extraction_GUI.py* by creating a new file  ```nano /home/pi/Desktop/Contour_Extraction.desktop``` on the desktop
* Copy the following text: 
 ``` 
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=Contour Extraction
